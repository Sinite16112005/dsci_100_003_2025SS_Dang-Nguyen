# README: Project Final Report
A computer science group at UBC has set up a **Minecraft** server and is recording play sessions to understand how people engage with video games. In doing so, they have created two datasets: one containing player information and another containing past play sessions. The goal of this project is to use the data provided by the Minecraft server to address one of the questions posed by the project lead, **Frank Wood**.

The question I have chosen to focus on is question 1:

> **"What kinds of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data?" Specifically, I am interested in learning how a player's age might be related to how much data they contribute (i.e. total played hours)."**

I chose this question because I believe it to be the most valuable for the research team. Understanding which players contribute the most data is critical towards the research team as they need players who will contribute more than just demographic data in order to answer the other two questions posed by the group. Essentially, in analyzing and identifying the most valuable player group(s) in terms of data contributed I can help the research team in finding players who will be helpful in answering the other questions.
## Technologies & Tools

- Programming Language: R
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook 
- Packages: tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization, tidymodels for modeling, repr for notebook output formatting

## Methodology

- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore distributions, relationships, and identify potential predictors using visualizations and summary statistics
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis using tidyverse tools
- Developed and evaluated a linear regression model using the tidymodels framework
- Assessed model fit and assumptions through diagnostic plots
